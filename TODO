- Use simple stale/fresh values in cache.
- Replace them when you can, otherwise just label stale.
- When reloading, feel free to grab a whole subtree if needed.
	- In this case, remove the whole subtree and start from scratch.
	- Remove to check the `.is_removed()` function.
- Write some fucking tests.
- Store current data wrapped in `CacheData<T>` where to get it you have to potentially call out to DBus to get fresh data.
- Isn't ideal, but it's okay.
- It will, at minimum, be pretty fresh almost all the time, even if reads do need it.
- Focus on getting a working screen reader first, and a push-centered achitecture later.
